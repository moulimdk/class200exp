            <li>
                Consider that you are fishing from a common pond with a reserve of fish. You will fish from this pond for {{ num_periods }} periods.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the beginning of period 1, there are {{ total_endowment }} fishes in the fish.
            </li>
            <li>
                In each period, you can fish upto 10 units of fish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Between two subsequent periods, the population of fish grows {{ growth }} times.
            </li>
            <li>
                For example: At the beginning of a period, there are 500 fish in the pond, and 100 units are harvested then 400 fishes will be remaning at the end of that period. Then the total population in the next period is {{ growth }}<span>&#215;</span>400 fishes = {{ next_endowment }} fishes.
            </li>
            <li>
                If at one period, the population reduces to zero due to harvesting, then there will be no growth and no fish in future periods. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You payoff is the total amount of fish harvest over the 5 periods.
            </li>
