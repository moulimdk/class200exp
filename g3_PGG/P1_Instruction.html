                This game is called Public Good Game
            </li>
            <li>
                You are in a group of three.
            </li>
            <li>
                You have an endowment of {{ endowment }} units (Endowment).
            </li>
            <li>
                You can contribute a part of your endowment to a public good fund (Contribution). The rest will remain with you.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Public Good Fund
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Each member of the group you are in contribute to this fund. It can be zero (0) units.
            </li>
            <li>
                The fund returns {{ multiplier }} times the total contribution. For example: If you contribute 1 unit and the total contribution is 3 units then the fund will return {{ multiplier }}<span>&#215;</span>3 units = {{ pgeTotal }} units.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each of you will receive one-third of the total return. In the given example, you will receive {{ multiplier }} units from the fund. This is called the Public Good Earning.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Total Earning
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your Earning = Endowment - Contribution + Public Good Earning 
            </li>
            <li>
                Example: Your Earning = {{ endowment }} - 1 + {{ multiplier }} units = {{ example }} units
            </li>
        </ul>
